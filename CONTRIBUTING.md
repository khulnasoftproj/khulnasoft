## Feature Request

Please [create a discussion](https://github.com/orgs/khulnasoftproj/discussions/new?category=feature-request) before sending a pull request for Feature Request.

khulnasoft is simple and easy to use.
This is important for khulnasoft.

So we should be careful to add a new feature.
Your feature may be great and valuable, but at the same time that may make khulnasoft complicated and difficult to use.

And maybe there is a better way to solve your problem.

So please create a discussion as proposal at first.
