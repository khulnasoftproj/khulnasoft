[#403](https://github.com/khulnasoftproj/khulnasoft/pull/403)

The logo has been created by [@vadasambar](https://github.com/vadasambar).

It has been built with open source: 

* Built with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) 0.91
* Font: [Swasdee Regular](https://en.fontke.com/font/12135927/) ([License](https://en.fontke.com/font/12135927/licence/))

## Design Consideration

* Something that incorporates the image of water (khulnasoft) and package
* Minimalistic: should express the idea with less design components
* Scalable: should look good irrespective of the scale (favicon, t-shirts, print-outs and everything else)
